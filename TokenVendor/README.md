## Chronicle at EthGlobal Brussels Workshop - Create a TokenVendor Machine for Your Token
In this workshop, we will create our own ERC20 token and design a TokenVendor to distribute it. The TokenVendor will accept ETH and, in exchange, distribute our token to the sender. To determine how many tokens to distribute per ETH, the TokenVendor will need the current ETH/USD price that we will get using a [Chronicle Oracle](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xdd6D76262Fd7BdDe428dcfCd94386EbAe0151603#code). 

This workshop use Ethereum Sepolia, however you can adapt it for your favourite chain. You can find a list of supported chains [here](https://docs.chroniclelabs.org/hackathons/eth-global-brussels-hackathon) for Testnet, or directly from the [Dashboard](https://chroniclelabs.org/dashboard/oracles) for Mainnet.
